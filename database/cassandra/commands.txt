// open a separate terminal

brew uninstall cassandra
rm -rf



Cassandra Setup
Install homebrew if on Mac OS (other OS you have to find out how to install it on your own)
Check your python installation:
python --version
If you don't have it, install it:
brew install python
You will need Java as well:
brew cask install homebrew/cask-versions/adoptopenjdk8
We'll use AdoptOpenJdk:
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
Type the following command to find all jdk versions:
/usr/libexec/java_home -V
Pick the version to make default with the following script:
export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v <version number>`
To see the jdk version:
java -version
Now you can finally install Cassandra:
brew install cassandra
Start Cassandra:
cassandra -f
Open a new terminal tab and type:
cqlsh
9:09
I don't know if the AdoptOpenJdk step is necessary, but just run it anyways
